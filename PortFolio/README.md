# Wasiq ur Reham — Portfolio Website

This is a simple, responsive portfolio website built with plain HTML and CSS. It's designed to showcase services and contact details for Wasiq ur Reham, a tech-savvy veterinarian with experience in SEO, GMB SEO, YouTube management, Google/Meta ads, WordPress development, SEO content writing, blog image creation, brand optimization, and business consulting.

## Files included
- index.html — main website markup
- styles.css — styling and responsive layout
- README.md — this file

## How to use
1. Download the files (index.html and styles.css) into the same folder.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser to view the site.
3. Customize text, replace placeholder images (currently using placeholder URLs), and update the contact email (`hello@example.com`) in the HTML and the JS mailto handler.

## Suggestions for next steps
- Replace placeholder images with real screenshots or images from your work.
- Update social links and the email address.
- Add more portfolio project detail pages or a gallery lightbox.
- Hook contact form to an API or form provider (e.g., Formspree, Netlify Forms) instead of mailto for better UX.

If you'd like, I can:
- Convert this to a multi-page WordPress theme.
- Add more polished animations, or integrate a simple CMS.
- Generate optimized portfolio images and thumbnails.
